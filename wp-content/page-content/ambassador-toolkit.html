<h2>What is a letter-writing party?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A letter-writing party is a community gathering where people come together to write letters to their representatives about issues that matter to them. It can be a handful of people around someone's kitchen table or a larger event at a library or community center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me does not tell attendees what position to take on any issue. We provide the tools: who to write to, how to submit a letter, and templates that give people a starting structure. Attendees bring their own voices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Before your event: planning checklist</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Four or more weeks out</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Choose a date, time, and location (library, community center, coffee shop, home — anywhere works)</li>
    <li>Pick a focus topic or leave it open (open events tend to draw more people at first)</li>
    <li>Apply for a civi.me event grant if you need help covering food or supplies (see below)</li>
    <li>Contact your venue to confirm availability and any setup requirements</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Two weeks out</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Share your event with friends, family, and community groups</li>
    <li>Post in neighborhood Facebook groups, NextDoor, community bulletin boards, and school networks</li>
    <li>Let us know about your event so we can list it on the civi.me events page</li>
    <li>Download and print the letter templates and representative contact sheets</li>
    <li>Arrange for food and supplies (pens, paper, envelopes, stamps if mailing)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Day of the event</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">

    <li>Have a sign-in sheet ready (optional — some attendees prefer not to sign in)</li>
    <li>Set up a laptop or tablet with civi.me open if you have internet access</li>
    <li>Greet people as they arrive and make sure everyone feels welcome</li>
    <li>Give a brief 5-minute overview of what the event is and how it works</li>
    <li>Let people write at their own pace — no pressure, no script</li>
    <li>Help with envelope addressing, stamp affixing, and submission guidance</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>After the event</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->

    <li>Post any photos to social media if attendees are comfortable (tag @civime)</li>
    <li>Collect any unsent letters and mail them on behalf of attendees who asked</li>
    <li>Think about the next one — recurring events build stronger community connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>During the event: hosting tips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Keep it welcoming, not political</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People will come with different opinions on issues. That's expected and good. Your role as a host is to make sure everyone feels comfortable, not to guide people toward any particular position. If a conversation gets heated, redirect to the writing and remind everyone that civic engagement works best when many voices are heard — including voices that disagree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Help people find their topic</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some attendees will arrive knowing exactly what they want to write about. Others may not know where to start. Ask them: "What's something happening in your neighborhood that you wish more people knew about?" or "Is there a council or board decision you've been thinking about?" The civi.me meetings calendar is a good starting point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Use the templates as a starting point, not a finish line</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter templates give people a structure so the blank page isn't intimidating. Encourage attendees to write in their own voice. A personal, specific letter is more effective than a form letter. The templates can be edited, added to, or mostly ignored — they are scaffolding, not scripts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>For neighbor islands and virtual events</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can host a letter-writing party over video call. Set up a shared document with the templates, share your screen to walk through the civi.me meetings calendar, and let people write while on the call. This works well for Maui, Hawaii Island, and Kauai communities who may not have in-person ambassador support yet.</p>

<h2>Fund the pizza</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me offers small event grants to ambassadors hosting letter-writing parties and civic engagement events. Grants help cover the cost of food, printed materials, and any venue fees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How it works</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Apply at least two weeks before your event</li>
    <li>Tell us your expected attendance, venue, and what you plan to spend the grant on</li>
    <li>Grants are typically $50 to $150 depending on event size</li>
    <li>We'll ask for a simple recap after the event (attendance count and a sentence or two about how it went)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These grants are funded through donations and community support. If your organization wants to sponsor the pizza fund, <a href="mailto:hello@civi.me?subject=Sponsor%20the%20Pizza%20Fund">get in touch</a>.</p>
