<h2>How voting by mail works</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2020, Hawaii has been an all-mail election state. Here's what that means for you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Your ballot arrives by mail</strong> — approximately 18 days before Election Day. It's sent to the address on your voter registration.</li>
    <li><strong>Review your ballot carefully</strong> — you can research candidates and measures before marking your ballot. Take your time.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark your ballot</strong> — use a black pen. Fill in the oval next to your choices completely. Follow the instructions on the ballot.</li>
    <li><strong>Seal and sign</strong> — place your completed ballot in the secrecy envelope, then into the return envelope. Sign the return envelope — your signature is required and is verified against your registration.</li>
    <li><strong>Return your ballot</strong> — you have three options (see below).</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How to return your ballot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Mail it back:</strong> No stamp needed — postage is prepaid. Mail it early enough for it to arrive by Election Day. The county clerk must receive it by 7:00 PM on Election Day.</li>
    <li><strong>Drop box:</strong> Official ballot drop boxes are placed at locations across each county. They're available 24/7 during the voting period and are collected on Election Day. Find locations at <a href="https://elections.hawaii.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elections.hawaii.gov</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Voter service center:</strong> You can drop off your ballot at any voter service center during the early voting period or on Election Day. You can also vote in person on an electronic voting machine at these locations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's on the ballot</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your ballot will include some or all of the following, depending on the election:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Federal offices</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>U.S. President</strong> — every 4 years</li>
    <li><strong>U.S. Senator</strong> — Hawaii has 2 senators, elected to 6-year terms</li>
    <li><strong>U.S. Representative</strong> — Hawaii has 2 congressional districts</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>State offices</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Governor and Lieutenant Governor</strong> — every 4 years</li>
    <li><strong>State Senator</strong> — your specific senate district</li>
    <li><strong>State Representative</strong> — your specific house district</li>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>County offices</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ballot measures</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some elections include ballot measures — proposed constitutional amendments or charter amendments that voters decide directly. Read the explanatory text carefully. If a measure is confusing, research it before marking your ballot. You are not required to vote on every item.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Primary vs. general elections</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hawaii holds a <strong>primary election</strong> (typically in August) and a <strong>general election</strong> (in November). The primary narrows the field of candidates; the general determines who takes office. Hawaii has an open primary — you can vote in any party's primary, but you can only vote in one party's primary per election.</p>

<h2>Tips for informed voting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Check your sample ballot early.</strong> View it at <a href="https://olvr.hawaii.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olvr.hawaii.gov</a> before your ballot arrives so you can research candidates and measures.</li>
    <li><strong>Research candidates.</strong> Look at their official websites, public statements, and voting records if they're incumbents. Nonpartisan voter guides are published by organizations like the League of Women Voters.</li>
    <li><strong>Read ballot measure language carefully.</strong> A "yes" vote doesn't always mean what you'd expect. Read the full text, not just the title.</li>
    <li><strong>You don't have to vote on every race.</strong> It's okay to leave a race blank if you're not informed about the candidates. An undervote doesn't invalidate the rest of your ballot.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't wait until the last day.</strong> Return your ballot early. If something goes wrong — a signature mismatch, a damaged ballot — early return gives you time to fix it.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h2>Beyond voting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voting is important, but civic engagement doesn't stop at the ballot box. Most government decisions happen between elections — at public hearings, board meetings, and public comment periods. The representatives you elect make decisions year-round, and they want to hear from you throughout their term, not just during campaigns.</p>
