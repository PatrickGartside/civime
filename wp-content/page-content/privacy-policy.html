<p>civi.me is a free community resource. We collect as little information as possible, we never sell your data, and we never use your information for advertising. This page explains exactly what we collect, why, and how you can control it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If something here is unclear, <a href="mailto:hello@civi.me">email us</a> and we'll explain it in plain English.</p>

<h2>What we collect — and why</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you sign up for meeting notifications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you subscribe to alerts for public meetings, we collect:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Your email address</strong> — to send you email alerts</li>
    <li><strong>Your phone number</strong> (optional) — to send you text message alerts if you choose that option</li>
    <li><strong>Your council or topic selections</strong> — so we know which meetings to notify you about</li>
    <li><strong>Your notification preferences</strong> — how often you want to hear from us (immediately, daily, or weekly)</li>
    <li><strong>The date and time you subscribed</strong> — for our records and for compliance with anti-spam law</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not collect your name, your address, your date of birth, or any information about your political views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Double opt-in — what that means</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you subscribe, we send a confirmation message to your email or phone before any alerts go out. You must click a link (for email) or reply YES (for text messages) to confirm that you want to receive notifications. We will not send you alerts until you confirm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This process — called double opt-in — ensures that no one else can sign you up without your knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you contact us by email</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you email us at hello@civi.me, we receive your email address and the content of your message. We use this only to respond to you. We do not add you to any mailing list as a result of emailing us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>General site usage</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you visit civi.me, our web server logs basic technical information: your IP address, which pages you visited, and what browser you're using. This is standard for any website and is used only to keep the site running and to diagnose technical problems. We do not use this data to identify you personally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>What we do not collect</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>We do not use advertising tracking cookies or pixels</li>
    <li>We do not use Google Analytics or similar third-party tracking services</li>
    <li>We do not track your behavior across other websites</li>
    <li>We do not build profiles about you or your interests</li>
    <li>We do not collect information about your political views, party affiliation, or positions on any issue</li>
    <li>We do not collect information about your immigration or citizenship status</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>What we never do with your data</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>We do not sell your data. Not to anyone. Not ever.</li>
    <li>We do not share your data with advertisers.</li>
    <li>We do not share your data with political organizations, campaigns, or advocacy groups.</li>
    <li>We do not give your data to government agencies unless legally required by a valid court order — and we would notify you if legally permitted to do so.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>How we use your information</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We use your email and phone number for one purpose only: to send you the notifications you asked for. That includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>A confirmation message when you subscribe</li>
    <li>Meeting alerts for the councils and topics you chose</li>
    <li>Occasional service messages (for example, if we change how notifications work)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not send marketing emails. We do not send newsletters unless you specifically sign up for one. We do not email you about unrelated topics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Unsubscribing and managing your preferences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every alert email includes an unsubscribe link. Every alert text message includes "Reply STOP to unsubscribe." Either method removes you from all notifications immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also manage your preferences at any time at <a href="/notifications/manage/">civi.me/notifications/manage</a>. Use the link in any alert email you've received to access your preferences without a password.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want your data deleted entirely, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@civi.me">hello@civi.me</a> and we will remove your contact information from our systems within 10 business days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Where your data is stored</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your subscription information is stored on servers controlled by civi.me and its data provider, Access100. Our servers are located in the United States. We do not transfer your data to other countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Email notifications are delivered through SendGrid, a standard transactional email service. Text message notifications are delivered through Twilio. Both services receive only the information necessary to send the notification — your email or phone number and the content of the alert. Neither has access to your full profile or subscription preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Open source transparency</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me's code is publicly available on GitHub. Anyone can read how our subscription system works, what data we store, and how notifications are sent. We believe transparency about our code is the most meaningful form of privacy assurance we can offer.</p>

<h2>Children's privacy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@civi.me">hello@civi.me</a> and we will delete it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we change this privacy policy in a meaningful way, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. If you are a subscriber and the change affects how we use your data, we will notify you by email before the change takes effect.</p>
