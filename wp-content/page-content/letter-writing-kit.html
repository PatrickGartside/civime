<p>Writing to a representative is one of the most direct ways to participate in public decisions. This kit gives you the tools to do it: how to find who to write to, templates to get started, and instructions for submitting your letter through different channels.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me does not tell you what position to take. These templates are neutral — they give you a structure and you fill it with your own voice, your own experience, and your own perspective.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Find who represents you</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hawaii has multiple layers of representation. Depending on your address, you may have:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>A <strong>State Senator</strong> and <strong>State Representative</strong> in the Hawaii State Legislature</li>
    <li>A <strong>County Council member</strong> (Honolulu, Maui, Hawaii County, or Kauai County)</li>
    <li>A <strong>Neighborhood Board member</strong> (Honolulu only — 33 neighborhood boards covering Oahu)</li>
    <li>Representation on specific <strong>boards and commissions</strong> relevant to your issue</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h3>How to find your state legislators</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Go to <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/findyourlegislator/findlegislator.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capitol.hawaii.gov — Find Your Legislator</a></li>

</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h3>How to find your county council member</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Honolulu:</strong> <a href="https://www.honolulucitycouncil.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">honolulucitycouncil.org</a> — Use the district map to find your council district</li>

<h3>How to find your Honolulu Neighborhood Board</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Go to <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/nco/nboards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">honolulu.gov — Neighborhood Commission</a></li>
    <li>Find your neighborhood on the list of 33 boards</li>
    <li>Neighborhood board meetings are open to all residents — you don't need to write ahead of time to attend</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Step 2: Choose a template</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These templates give you a starting structure. Replace everything in brackets with your own information. You are encouraged to add personal details — why this issue matters to you specifically, what you've observed in your community, or what outcome you're hoping for. Personal letters are more effective than generic ones.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Submit your letter</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Email</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Email is the fastest and most common method. Most legislators and council members list a public email address on their official page. Use a clear subject line: "Constituent letter regarding [topic]" or "Written testimony — [bill number or agenda item]."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Mail</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical letters can be effective, especially for state legislators. Address the envelope to the representative's Capitol or district office. Use the address listed on their official page. Allow extra time for physical mail — don't mail the day before a hearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Written testimony for Hawaii Legislature hearings</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Go to <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capitol.hawaii.gov</a></li>
    <li>Find the bill or hearing you want to comment on</li>
    <li>Look for a "Submit Testimony" link on the hearing or measure page</li>
    <li>Written testimony is typically due 24 hours before the hearing</li>
    <li>All submitted testimony becomes part of the public record</li>
</ul>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>County council written comments</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Each county has its own submission process — check the specific council website for instructions</li>
    <li>For Honolulu, written testimony can often be submitted by email to the council clerk before the meeting</li>
    <li>Deadlines vary — check the specific agenda for submission cutoff times</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Public comment periods</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>State agencies post proposed rules and environmental documents for public comment</li>
    <li>Comment periods are typically 30 to 45 days long and are published in the Hawaii Administrative Rules and official notices</li>
    <li>Submit via the method listed in the specific notice — usually email or mail to the agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for effective letters</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Be specific.</strong> "I live three blocks from the proposed development site and here's what I've observed" is more powerful than vague general statements.</li>
    <li><strong>Be concise.</strong> One to two pages is plenty. Representatives receive many letters — a focused letter is more likely to be read in full.</li>
    <li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Even if you disagree strongly, a respectful tone is more effective. Representatives are people.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign your name and include your address.</strong> Anonymous letters carry less weight. If you're writing to a state legislator, they need to know you're a constituent in their district.</li>
    <li><strong>Write your own letter.</strong> Form letters are counted but individual letters that share personal experience are more impactful.</li>
    <li><strong>Send it on time.</strong> For hearings, submit written testimony at least 24 hours before. For public comment periods, don't wait until the last day.</li>
</ul>
