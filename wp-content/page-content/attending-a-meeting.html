<p>You don't have to testify or speak to participate in government. Showing up to a public meeting — even just to watch and listen — is civic engagement. This guide explains what to expect when you attend a government meeting in Hawaii for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class="notice">
    <p><strong>Just want to watch?</strong> That's completely fine. You can attend any public meeting as an observer. No sign-up required, no speaking expected. Sit down, listen, and leave whenever you want.</p>
</div>

<h2>What meetings can you attend?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under Hawaii's <strong>Sunshine Law</strong> (HRS Chapter 92), all meetings of state and county boards, commissions, and councils must be open to the public. This includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>State Legislature committee hearings</li>
    <li>County council meetings and committee meetings</li>
    <li>State boards and commissions (Land Use Commission, Board of Education, Board of Water Supply, etc.)</li>
    <li>Neighborhood boards (Oahu)</li>
    <li>Planning commissions, zoning boards, and advisory committees</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me tracks over 400 of these councils. Browse the <a href="/councils/">meetings directory</a> to find one that covers a topic you care about.</p>

<h2>Before the meeting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Find the meeting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meeting notices must be posted at least six calendar days in advance. Each notice includes the date, time, location (or virtual link), and agenda. You can find meeting notices through:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>The <a href="/councils/">civi.me meetings directory</a></li>
    <li>The relevant government website (county council, state board, etc.)</li>
    <li>The state's <a href="https://calendar.ehawaii.gov/calendar/html/event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eHawaii public meeting calendar</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Review the agenda</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The agenda tells you what will be discussed. It's usually posted with the meeting notice. Skim it before you go so you know what to expect. If an agenda item references a bill number, resolution, or report, you can usually find that document on the same website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Check for virtual options</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many meetings now offer remote attendance by video or phone. The meeting notice will indicate if virtual participation is available and provide connection details. This is especially useful for neighbor island residents attending Honolulu-based meetings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>What to expect when you arrive</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The setup</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Government meetings are usually held in a conference room, council chamber, or hearing room. Members of the board or committee sit at the front. There is a section for public seating. Arrive a few minutes early — some rooms fill up for popular items.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Sign-in</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many meetings have a sign-in sheet near the door. Signing in is usually optional for observers. If you want to testify (speak), there's typically a separate sign-up sheet — but if you're just watching, you can skip it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How the meeting flows</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most government meetings follow a predictable structure:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Call to order</strong> — The chair opens the meeting and confirms a quorum (enough members present to conduct business)</li>
    <li><strong>Approval of minutes</strong> — Members approve the record of the previous meeting</li>
    <li><strong>Public testimony</strong> — For agenda items open to public comment, community members can speak (usually 2-3 minutes each)</li>
    <li><strong>Old business</strong> — Items continued from previous meetings</li>
    <li><strong>New business</strong> — New items for discussion or vote</li>
    <li><strong>Reports</strong> — Updates from staff, subcommittees, or agencies</li>
    <li><strong>Announcements</strong> — Upcoming meetings, events, or deadlines</li>
    <li><strong>Adjournment</strong> — The chair closes the meeting</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The order varies by body. County council meetings tend to be more formal. Neighborhood board meetings are more casual and conversational. Legislative committee hearings focus almost entirely on a specific bill or set of bills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The language</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Government meetings use procedural language that can feel unfamiliar. Here are a few terms you'll hear:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>"Motion"</strong> — A formal proposal by a member. "I move to approve item 5" means they're proposing the board take action on that item.</li>
    <li><strong>"Second"</strong> — Another member agrees to consider the motion. Without a second, the motion doesn't proceed.</li>
    <li><strong>"Quorum"</strong> — The minimum number of members required for the body to officially conduct business.</li>
    <li><strong>"Tabled"</strong> — An item is postponed for future discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>"Executive session"</strong> — A closed-door portion of the meeting (allowed only for specific legal reasons like personnel matters or litigation). The public is asked to leave temporarily.</li>
    <li><strong>"Public comment"</strong> or <strong>"public testimony"</strong> — The portion of the meeting where community members can speak.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Tips for attending</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>You can leave anytime.</strong> You're not committed to staying for the entire meeting. If your item of interest has been discussed, it's fine to leave.</li>
    <li><strong>Take notes.</strong> Jot down anything that interests you, confuses you, or surprises you. This helps you follow up later.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't feel pressure to speak.</strong> Observing is valuable. You can attend several meetings before you decide to testify. Many regular community participants started by watching.</li>
    <li><strong>Meetings can be long.</strong> County council meetings sometimes run several hours. Bring water. Committee hearings are usually shorter.</li>
    <li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Keep your phone on silent. Don't interrupt proceedings. Clapping or booing during testimony is generally discouraged.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask questions afterward.</strong> If something confused you, approach a staff member or board member after the meeting. Most are happy to explain.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>After the meeting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meeting minutes are published after each meeting — usually within a few weeks. Minutes are the official record of what was discussed, what motions were made, and how members voted. You can find minutes on the relevant government website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If something discussed at the meeting concerns you, you have options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><a href="/guides/how-to-testify/">Submit written testimony</a> before the next meeting</li>
    <li><a href="/guides/letter-writing-kit/">Write to your representative</a> about the issue</li>
    <li>Attend the next meeting to follow up on how the item progresses</li>
    <li>Tell your neighbors about what you heard — especially if it affects your community</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Neighborhood board meetings — the easiest starting point</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're on Oahu and not sure where to start, attend your neighborhood board meeting. There are 33 boards covering every part of the island. These meetings are informal, usually held monthly in the evening at a school cafeteria or community center, and cover local issues that directly affect your neighborhood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Find your board at the <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/nco/nboards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neighborhood Commission Office</a> or browse neighborhood boards in the <a href="/councils/">civi.me meetings directory</a>.</p>
