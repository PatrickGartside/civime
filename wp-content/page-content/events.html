<h2>What kinds of events does civi.me host?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Letter-writing parties</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community gatherings where residents come together to write letters to their representatives. civi.me provides the templates, contact information, and submission guides. Attendees bring their own voices and their own perspectives. All issues, all viewpoints welcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Letter-writing parties can be small — a handful of neighbors at a coffee shop — or larger events at libraries, community centers, or university campuses. We offer small event grants to cover food and supplies for ambassador-hosted events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Community information sessions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Workshops on how to navigate public information in Hawaii: how to testify at a hearing, how to find meeting agendas, how to file a public records request, and how to use the tools on civi.me. These are practical, hands-on, and aimed at first-timers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ambassador meetups</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gatherings for civi.me ambassadors to connect with each other, share what they've learned, and plan future events. Open to anyone interested in becoming an ambassador.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Want to host an event?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't need to be an official ambassador to host a civic engagement event. If you want to bring people together around a community issue and you'd like civi.me's support and resources, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
