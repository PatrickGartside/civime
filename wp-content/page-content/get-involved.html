<p>civi.me is built by and for the people of Hawaii. Whether you have five minutes or five hours a week, there is a way to contribute. Here are the paths that exist right now — and more are on the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Attend and participate in public meetings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most direct way to get involved is to show up. Hawaii has over 400 boards, commissions, and councils that make decisions about everything from housing and land use to education and environmental policy. Every one of these meetings is open to the public — and most welcome public testimony.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't need to be an expert. You don't need to prepare a speech. You just need to show up, listen, and share your perspective when you're ready. Your voice is as valid as anyone else's at the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>How to get started</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Browse upcoming meetings</strong> — find meetings by topic, council, or date</li>
    <li><strong>Sign up for notifications</strong> — get alerts when new meetings are posted for councils you care about</li>
    <li><strong>Read the agenda</strong> — every meeting page includes the agenda and any available attachments so you know what will be discussed</li>
    <li><strong>Submit testimony</strong> — many councils accept written testimony by email before the meeting, so you can participate even if you can't attend in person</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most meetings offer virtual attendance via Zoom, so you can join from anywhere. Check each meeting's detail page for the link.</p>

<h2>Become a civi.me Ambassador</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ambassadors are the heart of civi.me's community presence. They host events, share resources, and help their neighbors understand how to participate in public decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a volunteer role — no experience required. If you care about your community and want to help people engage, you're qualified.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What ambassadors do</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Host letter-writing parties and civic engagement events in your neighborhood</li>
    <li>Share civi.me tools and resources with friends, family, and community groups</li>
    <li>Provide feedback that shapes how civi.me develops</li>
    <li>Connect us to communities we haven't reached yet</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Who we're looking for</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We especially want to hear from high school and college students, community organizers, neighborhood board members, and anyone active in a cultural or community organization. No prior civic experience needed — just enthusiasm and a connection to your community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We're building partnerships with UH Manoa, community colleges, and high school service-learning programs. If you're a student looking for a meaningful project, this is a good fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What you get</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h2>Host a letter-writing party</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A letter-writing party is exactly what it sounds like: people come together, learn about something happening in their community, and write letters to their representatives. It can be small — a few friends around a table — or a larger community event at a library or community center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me provides the templates, the contact information, and the submission guides. You bring the energy and the people. We can help cover the cost of food for ambassador-hosted events.</p>

<h2>Partner with us</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me is looking for community organizations, cultural groups, libraries, universities, and nonprofits who share our commitment to civic participation. We're open to co-hosting events, sharing resources, and building tools together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We only partner with nonpartisan organizations. We don't take funding or partnerships that come with editorial influence or a political agenda.</p>

<h2>Spread the word</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The simplest thing you can do is tell someone. If you know a neighbor, student, or community member who cares about what's happening in their community but doesn't know where to start — send them here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no ads on civi.me. We grow through word of mouth. Your recommendation matters more than any marketing budget.</p>
