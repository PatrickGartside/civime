<p>civi.me is built by and for the people of Hawaii. Whether you have five minutes or five hours a week, there is a way to contribute. Here are the paths that exist right now — and more are on the way.</p>

<h2>Become a civi.me Ambassador</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ambassadors are the heart of civi.me's community presence. They host events, share resources, and help their neighbors understand how to participate in public decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a volunteer role — no experience required. If you care about your community and want to help people engage, you're qualified.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What ambassadors do</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Host letter-writing parties and civic engagement events in your neighborhood</li>
    <li>Share civi.me tools and resources with friends, family, and community groups</li>
    <li>Provide feedback that shapes how civi.me develops</li>
    <li>Connect us to communities we haven't reached yet</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Who we're looking for</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We especially want to hear from high school and college students, community organizers, neighborhood board members, and anyone active in a cultural or community organization. No prior civic experience needed — just enthusiasm and a connection to your community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We're building partnerships with UH Manoa, community colleges, and high school service-learning programs. If you're a student looking for a meaningful project, this is a good fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What you get</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>An ambassador toolkit with everything you need to host events</li>
    <li>Small event grants to cover food and venue costs ("fund the pizza")</li>
    <li>Support from the civi.me team</li>
    <li>The satisfaction of making your community more informed and engaged</li>
</ul>

<h2>Host a letter-writing party</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A letter-writing party is exactly what it sounds like: people come together, learn about something happening in their community, and write letters to their representatives. It can be small — a few friends around a table — or a larger community event at a library or community center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me provides the templates, the contact information, and the submission guides. You bring the energy and the people. We can help cover the cost of food for ambassador-hosted events.</p>

<h2>Spread the word</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The simplest thing you can do is tell someone. If you know a neighbor, student, or community member who cares about what's happening in their community but doesn't know where to start — send them here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no ads on civi.me. We grow through word of mouth. Your recommendation matters more than any marketing budget.</p>
