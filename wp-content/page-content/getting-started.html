<p>Civic engagement sounds like a big phrase, but it starts small. It means paying attention to decisions being made in your community — and choosing to participate when something matters to you. This guide walks you through what that looks like in Hawaii and where to begin.</p>

    <p><strong>No experience required.</strong> You don't need to know how government works to start participating. Most of what you need to know, you'll learn by showing up.</p>

<h2>What counts as civic engagement?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anything that connects you to public decision-making. Some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Attending a neighborhood board meeting to hear what's being discussed in your area</li>
    <li>Submitting written testimony on a bill you care about</li>
    <li>Writing a letter to your county council member about a local issue</li>
    <li>Voting in state and county elections</li>
    <li>Talking to your neighbors about what's happening in your community</li>
    <li>Showing up to a public hearing to listen, even if you don't testify</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of these count. You don't have to do all of them. Start with whatever feels natural.</p>

<h2>How government works in Hawaii — the basics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hawaii has several layers of government that make decisions affecting your daily life. Understanding who does what helps you figure out where to direct your energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>State Legislature</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hawaii State Legislature meets annually at the State Capitol in Honolulu. It has two chambers: the <strong>Senate</strong> (25 members) and the <strong>House of Representatives</strong> (51 members). They introduce and vote on bills that become state law — everything from education funding to environmental regulations to tax policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The legislative session typically runs from January through May. Most bills have public hearings where anyone can testify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>County councils</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hawaii has four counties, each with its own council:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>City & County of Honolulu</strong> — covers all of Oahu (9 council members)</li>
    <li><strong>Maui County</strong> — covers Maui, Molokai, and Lanai (9 council members)</li>
    <li><strong>Hawaii County</strong> — covers the Big Island (9 council members)</li>
    <li><strong>Kauai County</strong> — covers Kauai and Niihau (7 council members)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>County councils handle local issues: zoning, property taxes, parks, water, roads, public transit, and local ordinances. These decisions often have the most direct impact on your daily life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Boards and commissions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hawaii has hundreds of boards and commissions at both the state and county level. These are appointed bodies that oversee specific areas — land use, water management, education, health, transportation, and more. Their meetings are public and open to testimony under the <strong>Sunshine Law</strong> (HRS Chapter 92).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>civi.me tracks over 400 of these councils in our <a href="/councils/">meetings directory</a>. It's the easiest way to find what's meeting and when.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Neighborhood boards (Oahu)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oahu has 33 neighborhood boards — volunteer bodies that serve as a direct link between communities and city government. Neighborhood board meetings are informal, open to all residents, and cover everything from park maintenance to development projects to public safety. They're one of the most accessible entry points for civic participation.</p>

<h2>Where to start</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pick one thing. Seriously — just one. Here are some good first steps depending on how much time you have:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you have 10 minutes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Browse the <a href="/councils/">civi.me meetings directory</a> and find a council or board related to something you care about</li>
    <li>Look up who your <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/findyourlegislator/findlegislator.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state legislators</a> are</li>
    <li>Sign up for <a href="/meetings/subscribe/">meeting notifications</a> on a topic that interests you</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you have an hour</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Read our <a href="/guides/how-to-testify/">guide to testifying</a> at a public hearing</li>
    <li>Write a letter to your representative using the <a href="/guides/letter-writing-kit/">letter writing kit</a></li>
    <li>Attend your next neighborhood board meeting (Oahu) or county council meeting</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you want to go deeper</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">

    <li>Track a bill through the legislative session from introduction to vote</li>
    <li>Attend a series of meetings for a board or commission to understand how decisions unfold over time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common questions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Do I need to be a U.S. citizen to participate?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to be a U.S. citizen to vote in elections. But public hearings, testimony, neighborhood boards, and community meetings are open to all Hawaii residents regardless of citizenship status. Your voice matters in public decision-making whether or not you can vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What if I don't know anything about the issue?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's normal. Most people who testify or write letters are not experts. You are a community member with a perspective — that's what public participation is for. You can also attend meetings just to listen and learn before you decide to speak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Does it actually make a difference?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Decision-makers in Hawaii — especially at the county and neighborhood level — regularly hear from very few community members. When you show up, write, or testify, you are often one of a small number of voices. That carries weight. Bills have been amended, projects have been changed, and decisions have been reversed because community members participated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Is civi.me partisan?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. civi.me is nonpartisan. We don't tell you what position to take on any issue. We give you the tools to participate and the information to make your own decisions.</p>
