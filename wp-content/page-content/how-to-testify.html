<p>Public hearings are one of the most direct ways to participate in decisions that affect your community. You don't need a lawyer, a script, or any special credentials. You just need to show up and speak. This guide walks you through the process — from finding a hearing to what happens when you sit down at the table.</p>

<h2>What is a public hearing?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A public hearing is a meeting where a government body — a county council, a state legislative committee, a board or commission — considers a proposal and invites community members to share their views. Public hearings are required by law for many types of decisions, including new legislation, land use changes, environmental impact assessments, and budget decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Hawaii, most public boards and commissions operate under the <strong>Sunshine Law</strong> (Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 92). This law requires that meetings be publicly noticed in advance, held in public, and open for public participation. It is the legal foundation for your right to testify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The notice of a hearing must be published at least six days before the meeting. It includes the date, time, location, and agenda items. civi.me's meetings calendar will surface these notices so you don't have to hunt for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Option 1: Submit written testimony</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Written testimony is submitted before a hearing and becomes part of the official public record. It is read by committee staff and often by the members themselves. You do not need to attend the hearing in person for your written testimony to count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> Written testimony for Legislative hearings is typically due 24 hours before the hearing begins. Submit early — the system closes at the deadline.</p>

<h3>How to submit written testimony to county councils</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each county has its own process. The general approach is to email the council clerk before the meeting with your written statement. Include the agenda item number or title in your subject line.</p>

<h2>Option 2: Testify in person</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In-person testimony means you attend the hearing and speak aloud to the committee or board. It is more visible than written testimony and can be powerful — especially for county council meetings and neighborhood board meetings where the members are closer to the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Step by step: testifying in person</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1. Find the hearing</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Check the civi.me meetings calendar or the relevant government website. Confirm the date, time, location, and which agenda items are open for public testimony. Not all items on an agenda accept public comment — check the notice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. Arrive early</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most hearings ask public testifiers to sign in before the meeting starts. Arrive 15 to 20 minutes early to find the sign-in sheet and get your spot in the testimony order. Seating can fill up for high-profile hearings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. Sign in to testify</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Find the sign-in or testimony registration sheet near the entrance or the clerk's table. Write your name and indicate which agenda item you want to speak to. In some hearings, you'll also indicate your position (support, oppose, or neutral/comments only).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. Wait for your turn</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public testimony usually happens at a set point in the agenda — sometimes at the beginning of an item, sometimes at the end. The chair will call names in order. Pay attention so you're ready when called.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. Approach the microphone</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When your name is called, walk to the microphone or testimony table. Start by stating your name and where you live (your district or neighborhood). You don't need to give your full address.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class="card notice">
    <p><strong>Example opening:</strong> "Good morning. My name is [Name], and I'm a resident of Kalihi in Honolulu. I'm here to testify on agenda item [number] regarding [topic]."</p>
</div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>6. Say what you came to say</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll typically have two to three minutes. Use them well:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>State your position clearly in your first sentence</li>
    <li>Give one or two specific reasons — your personal experience is valuable</li>
    <li>Make a specific ask if you have one</li>
    <li>Wrap up and thank the committee</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't need to read from a prepared statement, but it helps to have notes. A few bullet points on an index card works well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>7. Sit down and listen</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After your testimony, return to your seat. Members may ask you a follow-up question — answer briefly and honestly. You don't have to have all the answers. "I don't know, but I can find out and send it to the committee" is a perfectly fine answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Option 3: Remote or virtual testimony</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many Hawaii hearings now offer a remote participation option by phone or video call — a practice that expanded after 2020 and has continued for many bodies. Check the meeting notice for instructions. You'll typically need to register in advance to testify remotely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For neighbor island residents, remote testimony is especially useful for state-level hearings held in Honolulu. You have the same right to testify as anyone in the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>Practical tips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Keep it brief.</strong> Two minutes is usually enough. Long testimony is not more effective than focused testimony.</li>
    <li><strong>Speak from your experience.</strong> "I live on this road and I've seen this happen" is more compelling than citing statistics you read online.</li>
    <li><strong>You don't need to be an expert.</strong> You are a resident. That qualifies you.</li>
    <li><strong>It's okay to be nervous.</strong> Everyone is the first time. Keep breathing, speak slowly, and say what you came to say.</li>
    <li><strong>Bring copies.</strong> If you have a written statement, bring extra copies for the committee members and the clerk.</li>
    <li><strong>You can do both.</strong> You can submit written testimony and also speak in person. Both go on the record.</li>
    <li><strong>Bring a friend.</strong> Going with another person makes the whole experience less intimidating, and two voices on the same issue carry more weight than one.</li>
</ul>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>What happens after you testify?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your testimony becomes part of the official public record. For Legislative hearings, testimony is published online and accessible by anyone. Committee members and their staff read it as part of the decision-making process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decisions are rarely made at the same meeting where testimony is heard. The process takes time. That can feel frustrating — but your voice is on the record, and records matter when decisions are reviewed, appealed, or revisited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow up. If you want to know what happened, check the meeting minutes (usually published within a few weeks) or contact the committee clerk.</p>
